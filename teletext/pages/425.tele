[2K  Best Current Practises
[2K  =========================
[2K  1. Authors MUST NOT implement bugs.
[2K  2. If bugs are introduced in code, they MUST be clearly documented.
[2K  3. When implementing specifications that are broken by design,
[2K     it is RECOMMENDED to aggregate multiple smaller bugs into one larger bug.
[2K     This will be easier to document:
[2K       rather than having a lot of hard-to-track inconsequential bugs,
[2K       there will be only a few easy-to-recognise significant bugs
[2K  4. The aphorism "It's not a bug, it's a feature" is considered rude.
[2K  5. Assume all external input is the result of (a series of) bugs.
[2K     (Especially in machine-to-machine applications
[2K      such as implementations of network protocols.)
[2K  6. In fact, assume all internal inputs also are the result of bugs.

[2K  Security Considerations
[2K  ==========================
[2K  As it is assumed that there is an even distribution of bugs through
[2K  all software, it is safe to consider any piece of software to be bug
[2K  free once a certain number of bugs have been found.
